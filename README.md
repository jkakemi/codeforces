# ðŸŸ£ Codeforces Practice

This repository contains solutions to problems I've solved on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), one of the most respected competitive programming platforms worldwide.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Improve performance in Div2 and Div3 contests.
- Master problem types like:
  - Greedy algorithms
  - Number theory
  - Dynamic programming
  - Graph algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ About the Problems
Each solution is organized by contest ID or problem code. My solutions are written in C++ and follow Codeforcesâ€™ input/output standards.

## ðŸ§  Why Codeforces?
Participating in Codeforces contests sharpens my speed, accuracy, and ability to think under pressure. It's my main environment for high-stakes training and measuring progress.
